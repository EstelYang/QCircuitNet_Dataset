Given the initial state $\ket{0}^{\otimes n}$, we want to apply a quantum circuit $C$ to transform it into a target state $\ket{\psi}$, i.e. $C \ket{0}^{\otimes n} = \ket{\psi}$. It is known that the transformation operator can be implemented with the approximately universal gate set: {H, S, T, CNOT} without ancilla qubits. The input and output qubits are indexed from $0$ to $nâˆ’1$. Please design a circuit based on the above description, with $n=$ \{qubit number\}, and the target state $\ket{\psi} = $ \{target state\}. Please provide the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with OpenQASM 3.0 using quantum gates from the given set.
