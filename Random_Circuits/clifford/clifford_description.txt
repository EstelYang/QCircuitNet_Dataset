Given the initial state $\ket{0}^{\otimes n}$, we want to apply a Clifford circuit $C$ to transform it into a target state $\ket{\psi}$, i.e. $C \ket{0}^{\otimes n} = \ket{\psi}$. A Clifford circuit consists of gates from the Clifford group, including Hadamard (H), Phase (S), and CNOT gates. It is known that the transformation can be constructed without ancilla qubits. The input and output qubits are indexed from $0$ to $nâˆ’1$. Please design a circuit based on the above description, with $n=$ \{qubit number\}, and the target state $\ket{\psi} = $ \{target state\}. Please provide the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with OpenQASM 3.0 using quantum gates from the given set.
