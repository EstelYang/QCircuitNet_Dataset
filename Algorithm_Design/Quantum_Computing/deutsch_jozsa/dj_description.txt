Given a black box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \longmapsto \{0,1\}$. The function is known to be either constant (outputs $0$ for all inputs or $1$ for all inputs) or balanced (outputs $0$ for half of the inputs and  $1$ for the other half). Please design a quantum algorithm to determine whether the given function $f(x)$ is constant or balanced. The function is provided as a black-box oracle gate named "Oracle" in the "oracle.inc" file which operates as $O_f \ket{x}\ket{y} = \ket{x}\ket{y\oplus f(x)}$. The input qubits $\ket{x}$ are indexed from $0$ to $n-1$. The output qubit $\ket{y}$ is indexed as qubit $n$. Please provide the following components for the algorithm design with $n = $\{qubit number\}: 1. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with \{QASM / Qiskit\}. 2. the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit, aer_sim) in python which simulates the circuit (QuantumCircuit) with aer_sim (AerSimulator) and returns either "constant" or "balanced" according to the simulation results.
