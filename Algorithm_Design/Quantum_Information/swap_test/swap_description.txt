Given two $n$-qubit states $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\phi}$, please design a quantum algorithm to calculate the similarity $| \braket{\psi | \phi}|^2$. The states can be prepared from $\ket{0^n}$ with two black box gates "Psi" and "Phi" in the "oracle.inc" file respectively. Please provide the following components for the algorithm design with $n = $\{qubit number\}: 1. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with \{QASM / Qiskit\}. 2. the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit, aer_sim) in python which simulates the circuit (QuantumCircuit) with aer_sim (AerSimulator) and returns the calculated similarity $| \braket{\psi | \phi}|^2$ according to the simulation results.
