Consider the scenario where Alice wishes to transmit $2$ classical bits of information to Bob, but they can only accomplish this by transmitting $1$ qubit. Suppose they share a Bell state $\ket{\beta_{00}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}+\ket{11})$, with Alice initially holding qubit $0$ and Bob holding qubit $1$. Please design a protocol to accomplish the transmission of the $2$-bit classical information \{ 00 / 01 / 10 / 11 \}. Please provide the following components for the algorithm design: 1. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with \{QASM / Qiskit\}. 2. the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit, aer_sim) in python which simulates the circuit (QuantumCircuit) with aer_sim (AerSimulator) and returns the decoded classical information according to the simulation results.
