Consider the scenario where Alice wishes to transmit the quantum information encoded in a $1$-qubit state $\ket{\psi}=\alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}$ to Bob, but they only have a classical channel. Assume they also share a Bell state $\ket{\beta_{00}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00} + \ket{11})$. Initially the system is $\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\beta_{00}}$, where Alice holds qubit $0$ and $1$, and Bob holds qubit $2$. Please design a protocol to accomplish the quantum state transfer. The state $\ket{\psi}$ can be prepared from $\ket{0^n}$ with a black box gates "Psi" in the "oracle.inc" file. Please provide the following components for the algorithm design: 1. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with \{QASM / Qiskit\}. 2. the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit, aer_sim) in python which returns the qubit index of Bob's state as an integer, where circuit (QuantumCircuit) is the implemented circuit and aer_sim is an AerSimulator.
