The properties of quantum mechanics provide the opportunity to generate truly random numbers. Note that the criteria to evaluate random number generation include frequency test, autocorrelation test, spectral test, and others. Please design a quantum algorithm to generate $n$-bit random numbers. Please provide the following components for the algorithm design with $n = $\{qubit number\}: 1. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with \{QASM / Qiskit\}. 2. the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit, aer_sim) in python which simulates the circuit (QuantumCircuit) with aer_sim (AerSimulator) and returns the generated random number according to the simulation results.
