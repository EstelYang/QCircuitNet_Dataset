Consider the scenario where Alice and Bob wish to communicate over a quantum channel provided by a third party Eve. Suppose Alice and Bob transmit $n$ qubits in total. Please design a protocol that allows Alice and Bob to transmit a secret key and determine whether Eve is eavesdropping. The operation of Eve is provided like a black-box gate named "Eve_Oracle" in the "oracle.inc" file which operates on the transmitted qubits. It could be nothing, or could be interception as measurements. Please provide the following components for the algorithm design with $n = $\{qubit number\}: 1. the pre-processing code setup_circuit(n) in python which sets up the necessary classical information to create the circuit (QuantumCircuit) with qubit number $n$. 2. the corresponding quantum circuit implementation with \{QASM / Qiskit\}. 3. the post-processing code run_and_analyze(circuit, aer_sim) in python which simulates the circuit (QuantumCircuit) with aer_sim (AerSimulator) and returns "Success" and the secret key if the transmission succeeds without interception, and returns "Fail" and an intended key if the transmission fails with interception.
